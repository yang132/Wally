# Wally
Wally is a programming language that can use only zeros and whitespace

This project contains the parser and interpreter for Wally, as well as some example programs.
Wally can either be written as all zeros and whitespace or as a shorthad notation that denotes the number of consecutive zeros before whitespace. There are example files for both methods.

To run a program, pass the desired file name as an argument to Main
